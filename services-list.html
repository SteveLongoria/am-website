<ul>
<li>If you increase your star rating by one star they you increase your gross sales by up to 10%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We believe that it is more important to build your reputation first and then market your business with your reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Review monitoring - You are not being notified of reviews as they come in from the top 20 directories. If you don&rsquo;t know when somebody posts a review then you lose the opportunity to respond to the review. Also, if you don&rsquo;t find out about your reviews quickly then you lose the opportunity to communicate with the person to have them change or remove their review. We let you know within 24 hours of any new reviews that are posted so that you can respond.</p>
<p>Feedback page - You don&rsquo;t have a page on your web site where people can leave you a 1st party review and or a 3rd party review. Without a feedback page on your site you will get fewer 5 star reviews for your business.</p>
<p>Review culture training - Your team is not educated on how to get reviews and why it is important for them to get reviews. You&rsquo;re missing out on the &ldquo;window of reciprocity&rdquo; that takes place after your customer is happy. You don&rsquo;t know what to ask somebody to say in their review to make the review as effective as possible. After your team experiences the review culture training they will know exactly how to ask for a review and will be motivated to get more reviews. This is our secret weapon in getting reviews. The companies that implement our review culture training capture 3 to 5 times more reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>73% of people that are asked to leave a review will leave one</li>
</ul>
<p>Google naked link - You don&rsquo;t have a simple way to get reviews on Google for your business. The number one reason why businesses don&rsquo;t get reviews on Google is because they don&rsquo;t know where to send people to leave a review. You can send a customer directly to where they leave a Google review for your business (no extra clicking required)With this magical &ldquo;Google Naked Link&rdquo; by texting, emailing or chatting the link and</p>
<p>Email campaign - You don&rsquo;t have a way to send a sequence of emails to your customers and request that they leave you a review. You don&rsquo;t have a proven sequence of emails to send that is effective at getting reviews. We typically get 5% of the people we email to leave you a review. Think of this as the &ldquo;Easy button&rdquo; for getting many review&rsquo;s quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Post 5 star reviews to the web site - You don&rsquo;t have a way to display your most 5 star reviews to your website. Social proof is one of the 5 &ldquo;psychological triggers&rdquo; that gets people to take action. If you are not showing people your 5 star reviews then your missing an opportunity to market your business with your current reviews.</p>
<p>Post a review image weekly to 7 social media sites - You currently are not posting reviews to your social media sites. We post one review image per week to up to 7 of your social media sites that display your brand, the review, and the authority of the directory.</p>
<p>Review video&rsquo;s - You are not reaching your audience on YouTube (the number two search engine) with a video highlighting your 5 star reviews. We post 1 review video per month using our spokesmodel, green screen technology, and prime time graphics. These review videos will be displayed on both YouTube and Google. The video&rsquo;s display on Google as a thumbnail image in the search results making your business stand out above the competition. Each one of these review video&rsquo;s is like a little salesperson working 24 hours/7 days a week to sell your business with your 5 star reviews.</p>
<p>Review print material - You are not reminding people when they visit your location to leave you a review with printed material. You are getting fewer reviews because you don&rsquo;t have posters, flyers, table tents etc. to remind people to leave your business a review.</p>

<p id="chatmkt"><strong>Chat Marketing</strong></p>
<p>You are currently not starting conversations with your web site visitors. You are not automating the process of qualifying the leads on your homepage. You have no way to stay in communication with the traffic on your website. You don&rsquo;t have a way to have your team to be notified when their biggest prospects are visiting the site so they can start a conversation with them. Your sales process is slow and ineffective. You have no way to communicate with people in a way that is quick and easy.</p>
<p>Chat marketing allows you to decrease your sales process by up to 50%. Chat marketing will give you a 20 to 40% increase in leads. Chat marketing allows you to communicate more effectively with text, audio, screencast, and head shot video.</p>
<p id="lpdesign"><strong>Landing Page Design</strong><br /><br />A lot of business websites are designed to accommodate traffic that is interested in numerous things. Unfortunately for Ad Campaigns, sending traffic to an average business site is not going to lead in a high conversion rate simply because there are too many links for them to click on, too many options that are simply not relevant to them.<br /><br />In our experience, you generally achieve a much higher conversion rate sending Ad Traffic to a page that's dedicated to offering one thing. It leads the visitor down a single path of action with minimal distractions. These pages are called 'landing pages' in the digital ad world.<br /><br />Here at Accelerate Marketing we design high converting landing pages that match the look and feel of your website in order to increase the ROI of your ad campaigns.</p>
<p id="salescopy"><strong>Sales Copy</strong><br /><br />A landing page wouldn't be complete without a 3-part sales letter, one that builds tension in the reader and has them practically begging for your services by the end of the copy.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is why we also specialize in crafting custom copy that first gets the readers attention by mirroring the pain they're facing right now, shows them hope for a better future, a future that is achievable where this pain no longer exists, and then finally the solution that will bring them from pain to dream; your product or service.</p>
